Build a DOM structure for the app with useful IDs and classes that will allow easy manipulation from JavaScript
In the $(document).ready() handler, add a click event handler to your "Create" button that calls a function on TodoApp, which will create the item from the text in the form field
Create a constructor for TodoItem, and implement a function that creates and returns an HTML element with the appropriate properties that TodoApp can insert
Add TodoItem functions to generate the Complete and Delete buttons, and incorporate them into the "rendered" DOM node
Make TodoItem responsible for preventing blank items from being created (think validators in Rails)
Add properties on TodoItem for "created at" and "completed at", set them at the appropriate points in the code, and incorporate this info into the item's "rendered" DOM node
Add links to both lists for sorting items either by creation/completion date or alphabetically, with click handlers that call a function on TodoApp which does the sorting
